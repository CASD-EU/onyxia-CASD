# Setting up the development environnement

onyxia-web relies following open sources backend technologies:

-   [Onyxia API](https://github.com/inseefrlab/onyxia-api): For starting containers (RStudio, Jupyter) on demand on a Kubernetes cluster.
-   [keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org): For managing user's authentication.
-   [Minio](http://minio.lab.sspcloud.fr): For storing user's datasets.
-   [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io): For storing user preferences and custom environnement variable to inject in the containers.

Setting up this infrastructure manually is not documented yet. As a result, if you want to contribute you'll have
to connect to the services hosted on the sspcloud (INSEE's Data center in Paris).
The app is configured using [environnement variables](https://gist.github.com/garronej/e0f7485fac23e8aa0ceda6ce82256df6).

```bash
# Download the binary files (images, fonts ect, you need git LFS)
git lfs install && git lfs pull
yarn install
#Setup the var envs to tell the app to connect to INSEE's infra
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
yarn start # To launch the app
yarn storybook # To test the React's component in isolation.
yarn keycloak # To spin up Keycloak container and test the login/register page. See https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify
```

# Architecture

The is four source directories:

-   `src/lib/`: Where lies the code for **the logic** of the application.
    It this directory there must be **no reference to React** and it is not allowed to import things from `src/app`.
    `src/app/setup.ts` exposes a function that takes as argument all the params of the app: [address of the keycloak server, url of onyxia-web, ect...](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/4842ba8fd3c2ae9c03c52b7467d3c77f6e29e9d9/src/app/index.tsx#L59-L89)
    This store [is to be be provided at the root of the React application in `src/app/index.tsx`](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/4842ba8fd3c2ae9c03c52b7467d3c77f6e29e9d9/src/app/index.tsx#L59-L89).
    The only way `src/app` (the UI) should interact with `src/lib` (the logic) is by [dispatching thunk](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/4842ba8fd3c2ae9c03c52b7467d3c77f6e29e9d9/src/app/components/pages/MySecrets/MySecrets.tsx#L200-L210) [exposed in `src/app/setup.ts`](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/4842ba8fd3c2ae9c03c52b7467d3c77f6e29e9d9/src/lib/setup.ts#L412-L418)
    any by using selector to access states. All the access to the `src/lib` from `src/app`Â have been gathered int a single directory [`src/app/interfaceWithLib/hooks`](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/main/src/app/interfaceWithLib/hooks.ts).
    The store have two very distinct states: When the user is authenticated and when it is not. To test if the user is authenticated use [`appConstants.isUserLogin`](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/4842ba8fd3c2ae9c03c52b7467d3c77f6e29e9d9/src/app/interfaceWithLib/hooks.ts#L28-L31)
    if `isUserLogin` is true then you have access to `store.appConstants.logout()` else `store.appConstants.login()` is defined. [See example](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/4842ba8fd3c2ae9c03c52b7467d3c77f6e29e9d9/src/app/components/App/App.tsx#L194-L209).
    We chose to not make `appConstant` a slice of the store but rather an [object returned by a thunk](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/4842ba8fd3c2ae9c03c52b7467d3c77f6e29e9d9/src/app/interfaceWithLib/hooks.ts#L28-L31)
    because it stores all the values and functions that never changes (for a specific execution of the app, they changes in between reload of the app though, they are not constant as the environnement variables that are hard codded in the bundle.).
-   `src/app/`: The react code.
-   `src/app/assets`: Here should be placed the small assets [imported directly from the code](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/adf6de0a991fa63e70af17b3fa41849306808dc4/src/app/components/shared/Header.tsx#L7).  
    For bigger assets like video, you should upload them [here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/releases/tag/assets) and [hard code the url in the code](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/adf6de0a991fa63e70af17b3fa41849306808dc4/src/app/components/pages/MySecrets/MySecrets.tsx#L253).  
    To be able to import other kind of files as urls [like here for example with `.md`](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/adf6de0a991fa63e70af17b3fa41849306808dc4/src/app/components/KcApp/getTosMarkdownUrl.ts#L3-L4) you should declare the file extension like it has been done here [here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/adf6de0a991fa63e70af17b3fa41849306808dc4/src/react-app-env.d.ts#L6-L9)
-   `src/stories/`: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) stories, to develop the react component in isolation.
-   `*/tools`: All generic code. Everything that could be externalized to a standalone modules independent from the project.
-   `src/js`: Legacy code that hasn't be ported to the new architecture yet.

# OPS

To release a new version, **do not create a tag manually**, simply bump the [`package.json`'s version](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-web/blob/4842ba8fd3c2ae9c03c52b7467d3c77f6e29e9d9/package.json#L4) then push on the default branch,
the CI will takes charge of publishing on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/inseefrlab/onyxia-web)
and creating a GitHub release.

-   A docker image with the tag `:main` is published on DockerHub for every new commit on the `main` branch.
-   When the commit correspond to a new release (the version have changed) the image will also be tagged `:vX.Y.Z`
    and `:latest`.
-   Every commit on branches that have an open pull-request on `main` will trigger the creation of a docker image
    tagged `:<name-of-the-feature-branch>`.

You can find [here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/paris-sspcloud/blob/main/apps/onyxia/values.yaml) the Helm chart
we use to put the docker image of the app in production.

# NOTE (for self)

To login to local keycloak:

-   In `.env.local` set: `REACT_APP_AUTH_OIDC_URL=http://localhost:8080/auth`
-   After launching and logging in to keycloak create realm: `sspcloud`
-   Root url when you add the "onyxia" client in keycloak: http://localhost:3000
